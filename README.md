# Humanoid-Robot
Alpha v1 is a humanoid robot powered by Arduino and servo motors, designed for dynamic motion control and gesture-based actions. The project includes modular C++ code for servo coordination, predefined movement patterns (walking, waving, kicking, bowing, etc.), and a scalable framework to expand robot capabilities.
